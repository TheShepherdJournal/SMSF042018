Buddy night will take place on the evening of Thursday, April 26. During Buddy Night, admission to the rides is "Two wristbands for twenty dollars." This deal only applies if you are entering the carnival park with a "buddy." Individual wristbands are still $20 a piece.

As of right now, there is no word on when Buddy Night will start. This is a decision that the carnival operators make based on different factors such as the weather.

We will let everybody know as soon as we know when Buddy Night will begin.
