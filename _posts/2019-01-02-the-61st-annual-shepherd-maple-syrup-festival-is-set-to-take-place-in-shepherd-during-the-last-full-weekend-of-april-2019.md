<p> The Village of Shepherd will hold its 61st Annual Maple Syrup Festival on April 25-28, 2019. Started in 1958, the long running tradition will once again feature pancake and sausage meals flavored with Shepherd’s own, locally produced syrup. Returning events will include amusement rides, a craft show, car show, parade, live music performers, and more.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>The long running tradition is completely dependent on volunteers who help out in everywhere, from tapping the trees, to making the pancakes and coordinating the festival’s events.</p>
