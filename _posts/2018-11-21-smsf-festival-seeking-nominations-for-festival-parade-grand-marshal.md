Each year, a member of the Shepherd community is honored for their contributions to the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival by being named Grand Marshal of the festival parade. They may have chaired an event, volunteered, or supported the festival in some other way.

The Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival committee is currently accepting Parade Grand Marshal nominations for 2019.

Nomination letters can be sent by email to <a href="mailto:nominations@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org">nominations@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org</a> or by mail to Diane Courter, P.O. Box 87, Shepherd, MI 48883. In your nomination, please include why you feel the person should be selected as grand marshal including the way in which they have contributed to the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival.

Nominations will be accepted until December 10.
