The Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival Village Wide Garage Sales group will be again be supporting garage salers as they seek out bargains and special treasures during this year’s festival. The group is in its fourth year of operation, and currently has over 800 members.

The group’s owner, Jeff Parsons, says that he spends the time and effort on the group because it helps the community.

“I've always loved the festival, and this is one way I can give back and volunteer to help promote it,” he said. “I know the sales are not officially recognized events for the festival, but they do bring a lot of people into the community. And the extra attendance can only help the community and the festival to grow.”

He is also motivated by the chance to help both the garage salers and the garage sale operators. “I ask for feedback every year after it’s over, and they are all enthusiastic about the list and map and appreciate the fact the it is there,” he said.

Being a garage sale enthusiast myself, the group was originally something that I had launched a year or two before Jeff became involved. As I became busier with other aspects of the festival, however, I found that I had less time to devote towards maintaining the group. Also, the Shepherd Police Department had been registering festival garage sales so the group wasn’t as relevant. Then four years ago the SPD stopped offering the garage sale registry, and I came across a link to a registration form that Jeff had shared online.

Jeff decided to publish an online garage sale registry of his own when he noticed that members of the community missed having one. “I was home sick for three days that year, so I started playing with Google docs and maps and figured out how to make it work,” he said.

I asked Jeff to take over as the owner of the group, and since then he has grown it into a garage saling community on Facebook. I’ve also appreciated his support and feedback over the years.

This year, the group will once again feature an online garage sale registration form, a google map, and a list. New this year will be a flyer with a QR Code which Jeff has been sharing with garage sale operators which they can post during their sales. Visitors will be able to view an online list of festival garage sales by scanning this code with their smartphones.
