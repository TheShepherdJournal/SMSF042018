<span style="font-weight: 400;">The 2018 Princesses and Runner Ups were crowned Tuesday night during the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival Princess pageant.  The pageant theme was “Boots and Tiaras,” and the evening was lead by master of ceremonies Deb McLoughlin.</span>

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Highlights of the pageant included the talent portion, during which contestants sang, dance, read a poem, and gave a speech, and a questions portion during which contestants each responded to a question. The 2017 Princesses and Runner Ups were on hand to describe their experience and to help during the crowning ceremony.</span>
