The SMSF Committee is looking for an individual who would be interested in organizing and directing a Talent Show during the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival. This would be an opportunity to bring back an event that has been missing from the festival schedule during the last few years.

Anybody who is interested can contact Pete Alexander via email at <a href="mailto:pete.alexander@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org">pete.alexander@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org</a> or by phone at (989) 828-5422.
