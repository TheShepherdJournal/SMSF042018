BOOK GIVEAWAY

FREE BOOKS FOR KIDS

For the third consecutive year, the Shepherd Community Friends of the Library will be on hand to give out children’s books during the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival. The Book Giveaway locations will be:
<ul>
 	<li>Saturday, April 28 10:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. West end of Vendor Booths near the high school (If the weather does not cooperate, find us in the elementary school gym from 1-3 pm, maybe earlier.)</li>
 	<li>Sunday, April 29 1:30 p.m. to the end of the parade In front of Shepherd UMC (If the weather does not cooperate, the Book Giveaway will be in the entryway of Shepherd UMC.)</li>
</ul>
The Shepherd Community Friends of the Library are wholeheartedly dedicated to making sure that every child has access to books and that all children learn to appreciate books and develop a lifelong love of reading. At the end of the 2018 Maple Syrup Festival, the Friends of the Library will have given away nearly 2000 books. “The look on each kid’s face when they receive a brand new book warms our hearts and makes us smile, too,” says Janet Leiferman, who spearheads the Book Giveaway each year.

Moms, dads, grandmas and grandpas get a kick out of the Book Giveaway, too, many of whom take books home to budding readers who did not accompany them to the Maple Syrup Festival. There will be books for pre-readers through teens.
