It’s Maple Syrup Time in Shepherd, Michigan! Once again Joyce and Phil Leonard want to invite you to the Community Dance, held on Saturday, April 28 inside the St. Vincent DePaul Parish Hall, at 205 E. Maple Street, from 7:30 p.m. to 10 p.m. as a part of the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival.

Joyce, Michigan’s Yodeling Sweetheart, and Phil’s Tumbleweed Band will bring you the best in traditional country, western, gospel, patriotic, and yodel music for your listening and dancing pleasure. Line dancers are welcome. Come out and enjoy this “Community Reunion” with friends and family. The Tumbleweed Band includes Phil and Joyce Leonard from St. Louis (Shepherd graduates), Jerry Mawhorter from Gladwin, Elmer Otto from Riverdale, and Bill Bryant (Shepherd graduate) from Shepherd.

This event is sponsored by the Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival, and there is no charge for admission. Refreshments will be available for a donation to a local worthy group.

The Leonards are in the Michigan Country Music Hall of Fame and the National Traditional Country Music Hall of Fame. They have performed in Bronson, MO, at the Star Theater, the Hall of Fame Theater in the Branson Mall, and Silver Dollar City; Opry House Stage, Nashville, TN; Renfro Valley, KY; and throughout the U.S., Canada and Ireland. Their music is played by Independent D.J.’s around the world.

Joyce is an International Yodeling Champion and she and her husband feature several harmony yodel selections. The Leonards have been singing together for the last 60 years.
