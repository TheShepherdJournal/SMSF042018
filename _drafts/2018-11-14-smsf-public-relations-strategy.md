<ul>
 	<li>Event information (Calendar of events)</li>
 	<li>News and Announcements (Blog &amp; Forum)</li>
 	<li>Contact Information (Contacts)</li>
 	<li>Frequently Asked Questions (Q/A Forum)</li>
 	<li>About Us &amp; Background on Festival</li>
</ul>
It will also contain the following additional features:
<ul>
 	<li>Discussion Forums</li>
 	<li>Questions/Answers Forum</li>
</ul>
<h1>Event Coordinators</h1>
Event coordinators includes anybody who is the lead for an event. This includes chairs, lead contacts, and event planners. If the event is being run by an outside vendor (for example, the helicopter rides), then the lead contact for that vendor is the event coordinator. The Public Relations coordinator will serve as an event coordinator under special circumstances or in the event that no other contacts or coordinators are available.
<h1>Event Information</h1>
General event information will be collected from each event coordinator and published or updated annually on the site. The descriptions will cover the following points:
<ul>
 	<li>Name of Event</li>
 	<li>Coordinators or contacts</li>
 	<li>General Description</li>
 	<li>Rules (if it is a contest)</li>
 	<li>Start and End Times</li>
 	<li>Date(s)</li>
 	<li>Volunteers Needed</li>
 	<li>Additional information</li>
</ul>
Event descriptions can be submitted via:
<ul>
 	<li>Writing (see attached form)</li>
 	<li>email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org">webmaster@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org</a></li>
 	<li>online via a form on the site (coming soon).</li>
</ul>
Updates should be sent via email or the online form.

It is event coordinators’ responsibility to ensure that the descriptions for their events are accurate. The Public Relations coordinator will send requests out when the information needs to be reviewed prior to publication in any printed materials such as the brochure, placemats, etc.
<h1>Event Promotion</h1>
The festival has the following resources or channels:
<ul>
 	<li>Website</li>
 	<li>Twitter</li>
 	<li>Facebook</li>
</ul>
Promotional support is offered to all event coordinators, however everyone has the option of handling publicity on their own as long as they have submitted an approved description of their event and a campaign plan.
<h2>Website Updates and Publicity</h2>
As new information becomes available it will be added to the event descriptions on the site. However, updates that do not fit within the structure of an event description can be shared as a written or video update. This might include sneak peaks, discussion of an event’s main attraction, questions for visitors, retrospectives, and featured volunteers.

As much information as possible should be shared via the SMSF website because of its integration with other channels like Facebook and Twitter.

News items can be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org">webmaster@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org</a> or an online form which is available on the site (http://www.shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org/post-smsf-news/).
<h2>Forms and Downloadable Files</h2>
Materials that need to be distributed to site visitors can be provided as downloadable files on the site. This includes rules and registration forms. If your event will involve a registration process which will require web visitors to download a file, please make an note of it in either your event description or campaign plan.
<h1>Contact List</h1>
A list of festival contacts will be published on the site. It will be the event coordinators’ and other festival planners’ responsibility to maintain their contact information in the list. Contact information can be submitted via email to <a href="mailto:webmaster@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org">webmaster@shepherdmaplesyrupfest.org</a> or via an online form. Changes can be requested via email.

A downloadable, printer friendly version of the contact list will be provided.
