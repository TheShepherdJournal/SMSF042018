Today’s featured Shepherd Maple Syrup Festival event is the 5K Walk/Run which typically takes place on Saturday morning during the festival. The Run will take place this year on April 28, 2018. Participants can register by going to the website <a href="http://www.runmsf.com/">here</a>.

As someone who has witnessed the Walk/Run over the last few years, I have to say that it is always impressive to see a crowd of runners start down the course. Participants range from the young to the old, and from the most serious runners to those who are the most casual. But, it really doesn’t matter who is the fastest, because everybody is there to have fun.
