The Princess Pageant is scheduled to take place on Tuesday, April 24 at 7 p.m. Previously, it had been planned to be held last Sunday, but was postponed because of weather conditions. The pageant will be held inside the Shepherd High School Auditorium. The cost of admission is $3 for students, and $5 for adults.
